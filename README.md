<h2>Motivation:</h2>

According to a study in the Economic Times, online sales in India accounted for only 1.6% of total retail sales. This shows that despite the boom in the Indian e-commerce market, Indians are heavily reliant on offline retail stores for their day-to-day needs. There is a need of a platform where the retailers and producers can come together, communicate with each other and establish a synchronized retail space. 


<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>A user can choose to be either a retailer or a producer in the app. A retailer will be able to search for a producer based on various parameters like - name, location, business tag, reviews and ratings and can further connect with them to buy their products. Similarly a producer can connect to a retailer of his/her choice and can initiate the business. </p>
<p>Respace focuses on creating a connection between small producers and retailers so that their products can tap into a wider audience which they were earlier incapable of reaching through online mediums, such as social media marketing or e-commerce sites.</p>


<h2> Goals of this project: </h2>

* [x] To bring in maximum number of small producers on the app.
* [x] To build a full fledged profile of the producer which shows different products available with him, its reviews and ratings from fellow buyers, and other different features.
* [x] To provide the retailers as well as the producers a refined search on the basis of their search parameters - name, location, business tags, ratings and reviews.
* [x] To provide interactive map feature so that the users of the app can easily find out the other users which can be in the region of their business interest.
* [x] To create a messaging platform for the retailers and producers to connect on the app itself.

<h2> How to use Respace </h2>

* [x] Producers can register their account on Respace, login and update their business details like business name, owner name, profile photo etc.
* [x] They can set up their business profile with a listing of their various products and product details like price, availability and so on.
* [x] Retailers i.e. offline shop owners can log in to Respace and search for small businesses near them.
* [x] Retailers can then buy products from the small businesses and stock them in their shops to sell to customers.
* [x] In this way, small businesses can make their products reach more people and shop owners can help support and grow local producers :)
