# Respace

Our submission for InOut 7.0

This is a mobile application that is made to help small producers bring their products to the retail stage. According to a study in the Economic Times, online sales in India accounted for only 1.6% of total retail sales. This shows that despite the boom in the Indian e-commerce market, Indians are heavily reliant on offline retail stores for their day-to-day needs.
Respace focuses on creating a connection between small producers and retailers so that their products can tap into a wider audience which they were earlier incapable of reaching through online mediums, such as social media marketing or e-commerce sites.
